This project was done as a part of Computer Graphics Course, 6th Semester (B.Tech), Computer Science and Engineering Department, Harcourt Butler Technological Institute, kanpur.

To run on Windows

1.Install MinGw c++ compiler / codeblock .
2.Install openGL in codeblocks
3.open the main.cpp file and compile it in codeblocks.
